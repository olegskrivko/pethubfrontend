  "pathToSolutionTitle": "Path to Solution",
  "searchChallengesTitle": "Search Challenges",
  "searchChallengesText1": "Lost pet posters on the streets often create confusion â€” whether the pet has already been found or is still being searched for. Without additional information, posters can be misleading as they are not updated or removed in a timely manner. Additionally, posters deteriorate in outdoor conditions, reducing their effectiveness.",
  "searchChallengesText2": "Additional information about lost pets is often scattered across various social media channels and platforms, making it difficult to provide effective and quick assistance. To solve these problems, professionally designed posters with QR codes are offered, allowing quick access to the most current information about a specific pet on the digital platform. This approach ensures transparent and always current monitoring of the search process.",
  "innovativeSolutionTitle": "Innovative Solution",
  "innovativeSolutionText": "To effectively solve the problems of searching for lost pets, an application was created that combines information in one place and allows easy access to the most current data. It expands the capabilities of traditional search methods by integrating real-time notifications and interactive elements, such as QR codes on posters. This approach ensures fast and convenient information exchange, promotes community engagement, and allows support to be provided even to those who have difficulty using social networks or other platforms.",
